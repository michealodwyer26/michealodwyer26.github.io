# Writings from The Underground
[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com) 

This repository contains the code for my personal website, titled "Writings from The Underground". The design of the
website was created in February 2018, along with most of the website's writing. After some edits and revisions, I created this
repo, and the website went live, on August 6th, 2018. 

Thanks to GitHub Pages, the website is hosted, free of charge, at https://michealodwyer26.github.io/.

## Design

The aesthetic of the website attempts to give an "underground" feel, which, of course, means one thing to me, and something
completely different to everyone else. Anyway, to support this aesthetic, the website is quite minimal, in its colour scheme,  layout, and font . I also choose a "dark theme" for the website, which, in my mind, makes the "underground" aesthetic more 
prevalent. The layout is just a simple CSS grid layout, with the "sticky" left-hand side nav taking 20% of the screen, and 
the font used throughout is [Tex Gyre Heros](https://www.1001fonts.com/texgyreheros-font.html) which is really just a 
Helvetica replacement.

The main colours I used were these: 
 - black (nav background): #000000 
 - light neon blue (nav links): #0ff
 - light grey (for text): #B0B2B8
 - dark grey (main background): #202225
 - green (main heading): #1DB954
 - fuschia (sub headings): #E61A7A
 
Along with these in the "Contact Me" page:
 - orange: #FF9900
 - green: #FF9900
 - blue: #7289DA
 
## Pages

**Home** - self-explanatory.

**Bio** - a short, "entertaining" bio of myself.

**Contact Me** - contains links to my other profiles.

**List of Albums I've Heard** - a long list of every album I've heard in full.

## Edits?

I'm only human, so there are probably plenty of mistakes, in the website, in both a linguistic, and technological sense.
If you would like to fix something, you can fork this repo, fix said thing, and open a pull request.
