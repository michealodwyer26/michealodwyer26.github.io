# Writings from The Underground

This repository contains the code for my personal website, titled "Writings from The Underground". The design, of the
website, was created during February 2018, along with most of the website's writing. After editing the writing of this original 
website, I created this repo, and the website went live. 

Thanks to GitHub Pages, the website is hosted, free of charge, at https://michealodwyer26.github.io/.

## Design

The aesthetic attempts to give an "underground" feel, which, of course, means one thing to me, and something completely
different to everyone else. Anyway, to support this aesthetic, the website is quite minimal, in its colour scheme, and layout. I 
also choose a "dark theme" for the website, which, in my mind, makes the aesthetic clearer.

The layout is just a simple CSS grid layout, with the "sticky" left-hand side nav taking 20% of the screen.

The main colours I used were: 
 - black (nav background): #000000 
 - light neon blue (nav links): #0ff
 - light grey (for text): #B0B2B8
 - dark grey (main background): #202225
 - green (main heading): #1DB954
 - fuschia (sub headings): #E61A7A
 
Along with these in the "Contact Me" page:
 - orange: #FF9900
 - green: #FF9900
 - blue: #7289DA
 
## Pages

**Home** - self-explanatory.
**Bio** - a short, "entertaining" bio of myself.
**Projects** - a short list of my projects, with a description.
**Interests** - a page where I write about my interests.
**Contact Me** - contains links to my other profiles.
 
## Future Pages

**Albums I've Heard In Full**

In the future, I'll probably add in a page which lists all the *albums* I've listened to *in full*. Unfortunately, Spotify
doesn't make my "saved music" or library public, and the playlists I've created don't do the job either, so, since I've this
website I'll give you this information myself.

**Preferences**

I believe a cool page to add in would be one which shows my personal preferences between two options. As 

> Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox?

Mozilla Firefox.

> Emacs or Vim?

Vim.

And so on.

## Edits?

I'm only human, so there are probably plenty of mistakes, in the website, in both a linguistical, and technological sense.
If you would like to fix something, you can fork this repo, fix said thing, and open a pull request.
