						<h3> Top 10 Albums </h3>
				</header>

				<p> A tough list to create, for sure. Generally speaking, everything will move, except for Lather. The only real 
				difference between, say "Lumpy Gravy", and "Larks' Tongues in Aspic" is that if I had to take only one, I'd pick 
				the latter, so it's ranked higher. </p>
				
				<ol>
					<li> Lather - Frank Zappa </li>
					<li> Uncle Meat - Frank Zappa </li>
					<li> Are You Experienced - Jimi Hendrix </li>
					<li> Galactic Zoo Dossier - Kingdom Come </li>
					<li> Unrest - Henry Cow </li>
					<li> Larks' Tongues in Aspic - King Crimson </li>
					<li> Lumpy Gravy - Frank Zappa </li>
					<li> In a Silent Way - Miles Davis </li>
					<li> Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop - Jeff Beck </li>
					<li> Birds of Fire - Mahavishnu Orchestra </li>

					<h3> Favourite Programming Languages </h3>
				</header>

				<p> My favourite programming language is Rust, which is a safe, concurrent, fast, systems programming language. 
				I love the syntax of this language, the safety features are a compelling unique selling point, and its performance
				is only beat by languages such as C++. It's tough to say what the language is best built for, but, roughly speaking,
			   	it seems that anything which is written in C++ will be suitable for Rust. The language is still in development, 
				so Rust devs get a nice new update every 6 weeks, which is chock-block full of new features, methods, and the like.
			   	Your best bet for learning it is The Rust Programming Language, which, at the time of writing, I am currently 
				reading. </p>

				<p> I doubt Java needs a little summary, but, if anyone doesn't know, it's a general purpose, object-oriented 
				programming language which powers the world. I don't diss, nor hate on Java as much as your average "new" developer. 				Java had a job to do too, you know. Sure, it'll get the job done and, you know, won't leave you down, like. 
				Personally, I think it's a good fit for doing things like app development, and, of course, game development. 
				Of course, Java also has many IDE options, which is one of the main reasons why I like using it: I kind of hate 
				the IntelliJ platform, because it doesn't run great on this 7 year old laptop here, and when developing 
				applications which use Gradle, one would need an IDE to retain sanity, so luckily, I can use Eclipse, instead. 
				Other languages, such as Python, are only supported by IDEs which are built off of IntelliJ, but Java has more 
				options. It's fairly handy to learn, because every second tutorial on the internet on programming teaches Java. 
				Myself, I learnt basic Java from a book by Barry Burd, and slightly more intermediate from a Udemy course by Tim 
				Buchalka. Links in the description.  </p>

				<p> Python is the first language I learnt, like literally everyone else born in the last 50 years. For things 
				like app development, web app development, and game development, library support is sub-par, but you can still 
				do something in them, if using pygame, kivy, or flask is your thing. Also, for any kind of app development, 
				an IDE is a huge benefit, but that's an area that is lacking, for me, because I hate PyCharm, mainly because it 
				runs absolutely terrible, on my computer. However, for domains such as machine learning, and artificial 
				intelligence, it can't really be beat, because of the language's library support for these areas. In my opinion, 
				learning it is a doddle, if you've programming experience elsewhere. If you don't, it's likely the best place to 
				start, because of the syntax's readability, and its typing system. I learnt Python from a book called 
				"Hello World!", by Warren Sande. Back in the days, me, and my sister, learnt a little Python from a website called 
				"inventwithpython.com" which had one book targeted for beginner programmers, which is a sublime book. After I
				finished the first book, I read through about half of that book, before going to various video tutorials to learn
				pygame. </p>

					<h3> Favourite Books </h3>
				</header>
				
				<p> Alright, I don't read much. So, this section shouldn't really be here, but I'll throw it in, because why not?
				My favourite book is "The Outsider", by Albert Camus. Camus portrays a grey, unimaginabaly nihilistic world in 
				this stone cold existential classic. Next up, is "Waiting for Godot", by Samuel Beckett. Beckett's masterpiece 
				chronicles the antics of the two most boring characters, in the most boring setting with a boring premise of 
				waiting for someone, who never arrives. Regarded as the greatest play of the 20th centuary. Last up is "The 
				Godfather", by Mario Puzo, a beautifully crafted plot of blood, crime and Italian-American mafioso warfare. 
				We're done. Jaysus, I'll never make it on GoodReads with this level of enthuasiam for books. Not that I'd like to
				"make it" on GoodReads. In fact, can someone "make it" on GoodReads? Probably the more books you review, the 
				better, or something like that. Who knows?	</p>

						<h3> Favourite Movies </h3>
				</header>

				<p> I watch as many movies as I read books. However, I am a much bigger fan of "Taxi Driver" than I am of "The
				Outsider", so I'd say this section is more needed, in that I'm more opinionated on movies than books. My
				favourite movie is "Taxi Driver". Scorsese's masterpiece details the ruination of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro),
				a New York taxi driver who drives all the wrong people, during the night, because his insomnia prevents him from 
				sleeping regularly. Travis fantasizes of being the man who cleans up the crime-ridden streets of New York. The film 
				explores Travis's unique psyche, with the audience becoming more, and more accustomed to his atypical ways. As his
			   	mental health deteriorates, Travis begins turning to vigilantism, after his interactions, during the movie, only 
			   	serve to reinforce his detached-from-reality ideas. "Taxi Driver" is a psychological thriller like no other, with 
				strong neo-noir vibes throughout. If I were more eloquent, and maybe had more time, I could make the film sound more				amazing than it actually is, but the film speaks for itself. With a score of 98% from Rotten Tomatoes, it's 
				widely regarded as one of the best films of all time. </p>
