			<p> Welcome Party Shoppers! Presented here is the thrifty personal website of Michéal O'Dwyer. </p>
			
			<p> Expect to find an "entertaining" bio about me, a page of unbridled self-promotion where
			I write about my projects, writings about my interests, a list of albums which I have heard in full,
			and insider links to all the other places on the web where you may find me. </p>
					
			<p> Have a look around! </p>
