						<h3> A Consise Biography of the Life and Times of michealodwyer26 </h3>
						
					</header>

					<p> 16 year old Irish programmer, musician and idealistic realist. That's about it, read the rest only 
						if you're curious! </p>

					<p> Because of my age, one might infer I am a secondary school student, or "high school" student which is 
						true, I just finished 5th Year (the penultimate year). My sister introduced me to programming when I was about 
						9, and I learned a little Python but that was about the end of that story for a while. Even though I liked it 
						and found it interesting, it wasn't until I saw a T.V. show, Mr. Robot,  which essentially glorified programming 
						that I decided to revisit it. That was about 2 and a half years ago, and naturally I went back to Python and learned 
						enough to program simple games and whatnot. I learned Java later on for game development too since the libraries 
						written for it were simply better. I guess I'm interested in game development because like almost 
						everyone born in my generation, video games were an important part of my childhood. I loved Nintendo specifically
						and I can't help but feel nostalgic for those games. So, I guess there's some appeal in becoming the 
						person pulling the strings behind the scenes. These days, I'm learning Rust, a systems programming langauge. 
						Later on down the line, I hope to study Computer Science in U.C.C.</p>

					<p> When I was young, about 9 or 10, I used to take lessons for classical piano, but I got bored of that after a year 
						or two. Later on, I saw one of my mates playing a tune called "Rumble" by Link Wray, and I got inspired to 
						start playing myself! Bought the same cheap Yamaha Stratocaster rip-off as him, and went to the same teacher 
						he had. Luckily, that teacher was exceptionally talented and experienced so I learned a thing or two. When I 
						started out, I used to mainly play covers, but I don't really learn songs anymore. These days, 
						I mainly write music, improvise guitar solos, and study music theory. I also love recording music as well, even though 
						I basically own no equipment for it, I only ever bought a program called ezDrummer to make drum tracks. Later on,
						I'd love to record some music professionally, but that's probably a bit far-fetched for now! </p>
