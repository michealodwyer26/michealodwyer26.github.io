						<h3> A Consise Biography of the Life and Times of michealodwyer26 </h3>
						
					</header>
					
					<p> My name is Michéal O'Dwyer. I'm often told I'm 15 years old, and I live in Ireland. As you might guess,
				   	I'm a secondary school student, or a "high school" student, to any of you who may be American.
					I spend my free time playing a copious amount of guitar solos, and programming. (Not exclusively,
					however: I do spent time doing nothing on the internet, like most others.)
					</p>
										
					<p> Throughout my days in primary school, I was an avid Nintendo fan. I 
					attribute any "creativity" I managed to muster over the years  to the enlightenment provided 
					courtesy of the genius Shigeru Miyamoto. I liked the Xbox 360 too... While I intended to, 
					I never became a part of the "elite race" of PC gamers. Instead, I turned to becoming the person 
					behind the scenes of the development games. I became a "creator". Eat on consumers!
				   	</p>
					
					<p> Yeah, that last line is tongue-in-cheek, for those wondering. Anyway, I began programming
				   	a little in Python. I was around 9, and quite a dilletante. In around November 2016, I 
					saw  a very formative T.V. show for me. On seeing "Mr. Robot", I was inspired to pick up 
					the torch from failing hands around me, and live to fight on one more day with the compiler. 
					Needless to say, I began programming again, and for the last year and a half I have been 
					programming games in Python and Java. Lately, I've been learning Rust, and I do dare to say
					it's my favourite, and it's likely to remain so.
					</p>
					
					<p> In February of 2014, I began to develop an interest in the electric guitar. On seeing 
					my friend - "Theodore", we'l call him - play "Rumble", by Link Wray, I was inspired to pick up
				   	an electric guitar. I began taking lessons from his guitar teacher. Over the years, I listened to the 
					works of many rock bands, and attempted to replicate their sonic mastery on a cheap Stratocaster rip off,
					made by Yamaha. However, I'd say it was years since I actually learned a tune, and as a result, I do other 
				    things on the guitar. Namely, I like to improvise guitar solos over backing tracks I find off of the internet,
					and I spend time plonking around looking for something like a riff, melody or a chord progression. 
					Occasionally, I'll find something, and I'll record it using free software, give a really stupid 
					"working title", and then it goes into an archive of terrible recordings, which someday, may be arranged
				    and recorded properly.	
					</p>
					
					<p> In a futile attempt to predict the next chapter of my biography, I intend to finish 
					secondary school in 2 years, and study Computer Science in U.C.C (University College Cork). 
					</p>
					
					<p> I think that consisely wraps up the boring biographical deatails of myself.</p>
